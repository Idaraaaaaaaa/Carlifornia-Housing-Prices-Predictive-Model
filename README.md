# Carlifornia-Housing-Prices-Predictive-Model
Problem statement
Accurately predicting house prices is a challenging yet essential task in the real estate industry. Traditional methods often struggle to handle the complexity and variability of real estate data, which includes diverse features such as location, size, number of rooms, and various other factors. This complexity is compounded by issues such as multicollinearity and noise in the data, which can impair the performance of predictive models. Given these challenges, there is a need for an effective approach to preprocess and model real estate data to improve prediction accuracy.

The goal of this project is to develop a robust regression model that can accurately predict house prices by addressing the aforementioned challenges. To achieve this, we trained multiple regression models and selected the best-performing one based on key accuracy metrics. The ultimate goal is to offer a more objective, consistent, and scalable alternative to traditional property valuation methods, thereby improving decision-making processes in the real estate market and benefiting all stakeholders involved in real estate transactions.

Dataset description

For this project we will be working with California Housing Prices Data (5 new features!) which contains the Median house prices for California districts derived from the 1990 census. The columns are as follows, their names are pretty self-explanatory:
